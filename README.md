# learnopengl

learning opengl with www.learnopengl.com.


Just messing around making 3d objects, lighting and shaders.
Also some pixel fun with stb_image.

I have learnt a lot about graphics doing this project. Highlights have been using matrices to create 3d environments, discovering the power of shaders and post-processing using kernels - very cool stuff!
